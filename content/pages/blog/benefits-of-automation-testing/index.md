      Web applications today are getting more complex on a day to day basis.
      Stakeholders and clients have much bigger expectations of what web
      applications need to do these days. The days are gone having simple
      informative websites. Today a much more complex page with real time
      responses seems the new normal.With that being said, web pages today
      consist of a lot of moving parts therefore testing needs to be up to date
      all the time, and this makes end-to-end testing more valuable than
      ever.Bigger web applications means developers  also need to work on test
      coverage but this mostly takes shape in the form of unit and functional
      tests, but unit and functional tests usually check certain parts of code
      in isolated instances. But these parts often have to interact with other
      areas of an application. These kinds of tests won't point out if there's
      an issue with how two or more parts of the system work together.Automated
      testing can increase business efficiency, decrease the time spent on
      testing by personnel.This is where end-to-end testing comes in, they give
      the confidence that the entire application is functioning and working well
      together, with all these moving parts, not to mention end-to-end testing
      can also check that all your third party services are working.Usually,
      manual testers will test the entire application and if any, third party
      services. But like most applications today, they are big and very
      complicated and it takes up a lot of time and resources for manual
      testers, this is where automation testing comes in.Keep in mind that
      automation testing should not replace manual testing, but just regression
      testing.It's very important to find a balanced testing approach. A balance
      automation testing approach can free up the manual tester and they can
      focus and spend their time on other high-value work like exploratory
      testing.Manual testing should be minimized at all costs. Test automation
      increases overall software development efficiency.I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE
      SOME BENEFITS I HAVE PICKED UP ALONG THE WAY IN THE YEARS OF DOING
      AUTOMATION TESTING.FASTER FEEDBACK CYCLEWith manual testing, feedback on
      new features can take a while. Automation helps to reduce the feedback
      cycle. Test automation is very useful because it helps you identify
      problems or bugs early in the development phase, which increases the
      team’s efficiency.TEAM SAVES TIMEBy automating your test it  also improves
      communication with other departments and product owners who rely on the
      results of these tests. These departments can easily check reports
      generated of the automated tests and see what’s happening, and let's be
      honest, business like to see green on charts.COMPLETE MORE TESTING IN A
      SHORTER TIMESCALE.Testers can do more for less and projects can be
      delivered more quickly; helping to increase operational efficienciesHIGHER
      TEST COVERAGEManual testing puts a limit on how many tests they can do on
      a daily basis. Automation allows you to spend time writing new tests and
      adding them to your automated test suite. This increases your test
      coverage, so that more features can tested and therefore you will get a
      higher test coverageREUSABILITY OF TEST SUITETo start, building your
      automated test suite is a challenge. But, once you have figured out your
      suite, it’s very easy thereafter to reuse tests for other use cases or
      even other projects. The advantage is that you can easily hook up another
      project or app to your automated test suite.FASTER TIME TO MARKETNewly
      developed features can be continuously tested and validated with test
      automation. This reduces the feedback and testing cycle and allows your
      business to bring products to the market faster.TESTS CAN BE REPEATED
      EXACTLY.Any tester can run a script created by another tester, without
      having to have the expert knowledge of the originator. Repeating an
      automated script delivers more consistent results.LESS STRESS ON QA TEAMBy
      implementing an automated testing strategy, you allow your QA team to
      spend time on tasks other than manual testing.
