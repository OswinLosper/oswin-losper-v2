      Currently, I am a full-time Senior QA Automation Engineer at Loop. Loop
      develops solutions for businesses to optimize their delivery operations
      through optimized routes, real-time insights, and exceptional customer
      experiences.


      Prior to Loop, I worked at 20fifty, a company that specializes in modern
      application development and serverless cloud computing. Combining human
      ingenuity with intelligent technology.


      Before 20fifty, I worked at Wyzetalk, a company that specializes in a
      digital employee solution that unlocks the potential of an entire
      workforce. Before Wyzetalk, I worked for iPlatform, a company that
      specializes in insurance management software.


      Additionally, I held a full-time senior designer position at bOnline Ltd.,
      a UK-based company that builds small to medium-sized business websites.


      In my free time, I play golf, enjoy watching rugby, football, and American
      football, socialize with friends, and engage in gaming.
